Imagine you have a magic notebook that you carry with you all the time. This notebook watches everything you do on your computer. It can tell what programs you're using, like Google Chrome, Vscode, or Notepad, and even how much you type, like counting how many words you write!

1. Magic Tracker (Activity Tracker)
   This magic notebook (we call it the Activity Tracker) watches everything you do on your computer. It knows when you're working on something, like writing in Vscode, or when youâ€™re just playing around in Google Chrome.
   It also counts how many keys you press on your keyboard, which helps us know how hard you're working (or playing).

2. Saving Everything (Local Data Store)
   After the magic notebook watches what you're doing, it writes it all down in a secret diary (we call it the Local Data Store). This diary keeps everything safe, like what programs you used, how many keys you pressed, and when you took breaks.

3. Thinking Machine (Processing Engine)
   Now, the Thinking Machine (Processing Engine) looks at everything written in the diary and tries to figure out how much you worked. It can tell if you were in a flow state, which is like when youâ€™re super focused and writing a lot. It checks if you were typing a lot or working on a program without distractions.

4. Talking to the Web (Local Web Server)
   The Talking Server (Local Web Server) is like a helper that connects the magic notebook to a computer screen. When you want to see your work, this helper takes the information from the diary and shows it on a webpage.
   You can see a daily report: how much time you spent in each program, how many keys you pressed, and even add notes to say, "I took a break at 3 PM!" If you want to see your work over many days, you can look at the overview page that shows everything for the past week or month.

5. Pretty Visuals :)
   Helps you see everything in a fun way. It shows colorful bars that show how much time you spent on each program, and you can even click them to see more details. There are also buttons to refresh the page or move between days.

# To sum up
  Watches everything you do and counts your keystrokes.
  Keeps all the information safe.
  Figures out if you were working hard or just playing around.
  Puts everything on a webpage so you can see it.
  Makes it fun to look at how much work you've done.

  
Enjoy tracking and improving your productivity! ðŸ˜Š
